# XLM-UNMT-Models
UNMT trained models in XLM

### Due to they are too big to upload to github, I just uploaded them to Google Drive
Besides the pytorch model, it include all the meta data such as training log checkpoint evaluation data and so on.(Now there are only en-fr, I still work on training other language and will upload them soon)
